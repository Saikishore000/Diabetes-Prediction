# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning (SVC)

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on several medical features. The goal is to assist early diagnosis using data-driven methods.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle – Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- **Features include:**
  - Number of Pregnancies
  - Glucose Level
  - Blood Pressure
  - Skin Thickness
  - Insulin Level
  - BMI
  - Diabetes Pedigree Function
  - Age

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Platform:** Google Colab
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical operations
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` for data visualization
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning models and evaluation

## 🔍 Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing or zero values
   - Normalized features if necessary

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized distributions, correlations, and trends
   - Identified key features influencing diabetes risk

3. **Model Building**
   - Trained a **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** model
   - Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV (optional)

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy score
   - Confusion matrix
   - ROC-AUC curve
